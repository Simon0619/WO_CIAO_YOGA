      What we do
    </h2>

    <p>
      A sanctuary of strength and spirit in the heart of the city
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      We have a wealth of yoga studios across Asia, with prime locations in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore. Our reach went global with the opening of Hydrogen Yoga in New York - a collaborative venture with Equinox, one of the leading lifestyle brands in the US.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Our studios offer over 1,600 classes each week in a diversity of yoga practices taught by a community of over 200 passionate and dedicated yoga teachers. Hydrogen Yoga is committed to the ongoing development and education of our teachers. We hold regular workshops and in-house training, such as the bimonthly Maha Kula Gathering, our scholarship and internal mentorship programme. Our teachers have all benefitted first-hand from regular yoga practices and are continuously encouraged to attend external workshops around the world.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Beginners never feel intimidated because our teachers never forget they were once beginners too - going at your own pace is always encouraged. Advanced students can deepen their practice amidst people who have travelled the world, learning and sharing the joys of yoga.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      For those interested in training outside the studio, we have developed an online yoga and fitness platform called Hydrogen Online; enabling anyone on the go to take their practice with them. Here, you'll find a collection of videos featuring our community of teachers to supplement every need and style of practice.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      WO CIAO Yoga celebrates the diversity of yoga styles by offering a wide variety - traditionalists will rejoice in Hatha Yoga, Ashtanga, Mysore, Yin Yoga, Pranayama and Meditation; contemporary practitioners will thrive on the likes of Power Yoga, Wall Rope Yoga, Aerial Yoga and yoga dance classes; ambitious students will relish the personalised pace and programme of Private Yoga. Complementing this premium yoga experience are workshops with guest yoga teachers from around the globe, Teacher Trainings, Continuing Education for Teachers programmes, and retreats in idyllic locales that take yoga beyond the studio.

      Whether you are an absolute beginner or an experienced Yogi, we welcome you to share our space and become part of Hydrogen Yoga.
