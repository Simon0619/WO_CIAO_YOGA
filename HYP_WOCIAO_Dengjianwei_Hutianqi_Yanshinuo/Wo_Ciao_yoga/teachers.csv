1,Aiyu Zhang,"Guidence Course：Advanced Vinyasa，Power Yoga，Restorative；

Aiyu majored in Chinese Language & Literature at university and subsequently worked as an editor for several years. With publishing’s manic cycle and the long hours working in front of a computer, Aiyu was under a lot of pressure both physically and mentally. In 2009, she came across yoga, which brought her great release in body and mind. Her interest was piqued, she devoted herself to systematic learning and became a yoga teacher to continue exploring and sharing the profound wisdom of yoga. 

Aiyu feels particularly blessed on her path of yogic discovery with the guidance of Zubin and Chen Hui (Orchid). Zubin’s great self-discipline and sincerity for yoga affected her deeply, while Orchid inspired Nicole to share and express generosity and care to students. 

Aiyu’s classes place great emphasis on building a foundation in practice, which she believes will always benefit students in the long term. She loves to encourage students and even as the ‘teacher’ enjoys discovering the wisdom of yoga and growing together with her students.

2,Alexander Hodges,"Guidence Course：Advanced Vinyasa；

 Alexander was introduced to yoga through his interest in physical health, personal development, spirituality and his search for tools to better explore these areas of himself. Through an invitation to start a serious yoga practice with a group of good friends in 2013, his journey began and the motivation which grew from sharing the experience as a group gradually evolved to include a more personal aspect. The will to achieve a clearer understanding of himself keeps him motivated today.

Alexander is inspired by the philosophy of teachers such as Yolanda Pettinato, who aim to guide the practitioner to have a better, more meaningful and joyful life. He is indebted to Shanghai-based teacher Rajeev for deepening his knowledge and instilling in him a sense of tradition and reverence for the practice.

Those who join his classes can expect a well-intentioned teacher who respects every student and loves to keep a good balance of focus and humor. His classes vary in tone from physically intense to meditative and relaxing. Alexander wishes that attendees come only with goodwill and respect their fellow practitioners.

4,Allen Zhou,"Guidence Course：Ashtanga，kundalini；

Lack of routine and irregular living was the norm for an art student like Allen. Over time, his spirit wilted and his body began to look different. To improve this less-than-desirable state, Allen took the advice of his mother who had benefitted greatly from yoga. Led by her, Allen walked into his first yoga class and opened a door to another form of art.

Before that, Allen didn’t think much of yoga practice. His pre-conceived notion of yoga involved pulling the leg, twisting the neck and shaking the arm without any challenge. But the first yoga class was very different from his imagination. The various asanas, flexibility exercises, and the thrill of sweating instantly shattered Allen’s original concept and made him think that yoga is “cool”!

This ‘coolness’ deeply attracted Allen and his teacher Chen Ya’s love for yoga also inspired him. After long-term devotion to yoga practice, both his body and mind have benefitted a lot and when faced with choice of career, Allen very naturally chose his favourite yoga. In his view, yoga is an extension of art, learning as well teaching what he loves. After completing the intense TTC course, Allen embarked on an endless path of yoga teaching and learning.

Allen's class is humorous and passionate, and his youthful aura inspires practitioners young and old alike to unearth their eternal young soul at the bottom of their hearts.","Plaza 66, Xintiandi",https://www.pure-yoga.cn/images/teacher/91284-Allen-Zhou.jpg,1676777524
5,Amit Kumar,"Guidence Course：Ashtanga，Gentle Yoga；

Amit came into yoga world in 2004, while he was playing football match in ground. He saw there was a yoga competition and many competitors were performing difficult yoga poses. He was surprised how human body can be flexible like this. After performed they got some medals and prizes. Amit was excited to practise yoga and wanted to win prizes. So he immediately joined yoga at Karmakar Institute of Yoga. In the beginning he was so inflexible and he was also not able to do many yoga poses. His classmates told him that he can’t win in any competitions. Amit took their words as challenge and started practising everyday with determination. He finally mastered in asana, got championships and won lots of medals under the guidance of Professor Baishali Champathy Karmakar and Professor Prabir Karmakar. As time passed, Yoga became his passion so he decided to teach yoga so he can give healthy and happy life to people. According to Amit: Yoga is the key of happiness, it purifies our external body as well as internal, and will make us know how our life can be healthier and more beautiful.

He lived there with Indian traditional Yogic life style. In 2014, Amit was the participant of World Yoga Convention at Bihar School of Yoga with Swami Niranjanananda Saraswati. That was regarded as an achievement of him. In 2016, it was the luckiest time for him because he was selected by Kaivlyadhama Yoga Institute, one of the oldest and most traditional school of yoga in the world, offering the master class for yoga teachers. He met Professor O.P. Tiwari and learned deep knowledges about anatomy, physiology and pranayama.

His classes are for all level of practitioners, mainly focus in alignments, awareness and relaxation. He hopes to teach students that yoga is not just a physical practice but it’s a lifestyle.

6,Annie Wei,"Guidence Course：Ashtanga，Morning Flow，Yin Yoga；

Annie was originally a dancer and a dance teacher. She loves the fluidity combined with the connection of music and movement. But quite early on due to high-intensity training and incorrect practice, she accumulated many professional injuries and was continuously overwhelmed by the insufferable pain, which led to a period of resting.

After learning more about aerial yoga in 2015, she became attuned to her body and broke through any shortcomings to retain control of her physical capabilities. Thus began her journey of yoga exploration.

Inspired by Mrs. LoLo Luo, Annie ""reconciled with herself"" to grasp a real sense of her body’s needs and stopped forcing herself to be what others expected her to be.

Annie’s classes highlight the importance of basic stability and safety, and attainment of calmness and steady power from the alignment, perception, breathwork and concentration of the body.

8,Arven Xing,"Guidence Course：Power Yoga，Sunset Flow；

Arven had his first yoga class in his first year at university in 2007. During the class, the teacher mentioned frequently that people should not compare with others but rather live for now and self-reflect – such words impressed him a lot.

Due to busy studying, he only continued to attend yoga class for around 1 month. But even in that time, yoga became embedded in his heart, which inspired him to take yoga teacher training half a year after he graduated.

Whilst he taught yoga, Arven also attended trainings led by famous yoga teachers such as Andrey Lappa, David Kyle, Dougta, Li Xiaozhong and Qiu Yuan. Teaching since 2011 has given Arven ample experience to provide tailor-made advice to his students.

9,Queenie Zhang,"Guidence Course：Sunset Flow；

Queenie’s first encounter with yoga came from wanting to find her true inner self and the meaning of life. She has been constantly exploring and learning to discover more of this ancient and powerful practice. In 2013, Queenie was invited to a yoga class by her college classmates. Her initial focus was on upright practice and now it has shifted to breathing and energy and this pursuit has brought Queenie to where she is today. Queenie was inspired by four teachers; Rob, a teacher in Shanghai taught her the combination of having an innovative and classical approach when practising yoga. Teacher Jani from Poland taught her classical yoga, founder of Rocket Yoga, David, showed her how to practise it interestingly and teacher Kino from the United States gave her a sunnier way of living and practicing. Queenie is passionate about teaching, making people feel open and interested, bringing out the potential of her class participants and making them believe in themselves more. Queenie’s classes are humorous, joyful, and passionate.

10,David Yang,"Guidence Course：Hot yoga；

In 2001, after graduation, David started social work and the work of a nine to five made him doubt life. He came to the realisation that he has to do something he likes to do, and that was the start of his career in yoga.

David specialises in Rocket Flow Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, and intensive and targeted exercises. People are different, and he believes there are different ways to better share the experience and teaching of yoga. He cherishes his teachers, John Scott, David Swenson, and especially David Kyle, who has been the greatest influence and help to David. He taught David not to worry about everything, to do things with all your heart, be humble and low-key and be more grateful!

To David, yoga practice can fight against the impact of time on the body, it can improve the body, breathing, movement and allow us to have a better understanding of ourselves to have harmonious relationships with our family and friends.
